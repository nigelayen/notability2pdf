# notability2pdf
Forked from steventango/notability2pdf. 

This code will extract PDF files from within Notability .NOTE files. Python 3.x is required.
Adapted for my use case only. I do not guarantee it will work in all scenarios.

Basic usage:
  1. Backup Notablity (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
  2. Create a folder on your local computer (e.g. notability2pdf)
  3. Create a sub-folder named 'in'
  4. Download the .NOTE files from the backup location and save to the 'in' folder.
  5. Run "notability2pdf.py" from the folder created in step 2.
  6. Extracted PDF files are saved "out" folder created by the code.
